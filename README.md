<h1><samp>Concept</samp></h1>
You and your ship are suddenly warped through a wormhole and you find yourself in a galaxy infested with evil robots. Together with your crew you soar through the galaxy and defeat the evil robots. You find out that the only way back to your own galaxy is though a portal the evil robots made, but you can get trough the barier they made until you defeat all the elite robots. On the way you upgade your ship and when you defeat all the elite robots you can enter the portal and return back to your own galaxy.

<h1><samp>Limitations</samp></h1>
Friends in a galaxy is a school project that has the limitation of using only your mobile phone as input. Because of this limitation we use phones as a controllers. You also need two players to play Friends in a galaxy. One player controlls the ship and the other the turret.

*note: we also made a keyboard build so you dont need to use OSC.*

<h1><samp>OSC</samp></h1>
Max Coppen created a custom implementation of OSC comunication protocol using UDP.
