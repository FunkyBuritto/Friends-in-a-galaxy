On the way you upgade your ship and when you defeat all the elite robots you can enter the portal and return back to your own galaxy.

### Limitations
Friends in a galaxy is a school project that has the limitation of using only your mobile phone as input. Because of this limitation we use phones as a controllers. You also need two players to play Friends in a galaxy. One player controlls the ship and the other the turret.
